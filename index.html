        <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Field Tools is an efficient, easy to use depth of field calculator for photographers working in the field. Using just a few touches, you can quickly calculate hyperfocal, near focus and far focus distances, all from a single screen. App settings are also a single touch away. Features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large, easy to read result display</li>
<li>Switch distance type - hyperfocal, near limit, far limit and combined near/far limits - with a single touch</li>
<li>Sliders for adjusting focal length, aperture and focus distance</li>
<li>Configure multiple cameras and lenses and switch between them with just a few touches</li>
<li>Results in meters, feet or feet and inches</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's New</h2>
<p>This version revises the design to bring it up-to-date. As well, the app is now 64-bit, making it ready for iOS 11.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>Field Tools is implemented as a utility application. The settings "side" of the app uses UITableViews and UINavigationController to configure cameras and lenses. Hopefully, the source can serve as an example of a reasonably well written app that is a bit more substantial than the typical sample Cocoa Touch code.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bradsokol/iphonefieldtools/tree/master">master</a> branch contains source for versions that have been released to the iTunes App Store. To follow on-going development, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/bradsokol/iphonefieldtools/tree/develop">develop</a> branch.</p>
